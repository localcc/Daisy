## Example code

```c++

if (result != Result::OK) {
    std::cout << "Failed to initialize Daisy, reason: " << result.code << std::endl;
    return -1;
}

while (1) {
    DaisyManager::Get()->Tick();
    for (auto controller : DaisyManager::Get()->AvailableControllers()) {
        ControllerInput controllerInput{};
        if (DaisyManager::Get()->GetControllerData(controller, &controllerInput) != Result::OK)
            continue;

        auto outputData = OutputBuilder{}
                              .SetLedColor({controllerInput.analog.leftStick.x, controllerInput.analog.leftStick.y, 0})
                              .SetLeftMotor(controllerInput.analog.l2)
                              .SetRightMotor(controllerInput.analog.r2)
                              .SetLeftTrigger(AdaptiveTriggerBuilder::Feedback(TriggerUtils::Zone(0.5f), TriggerUtils::Strength(0.8f)))
                              .SetRightTrigger(AdaptiveTriggerBuilder::Weapon(0.2_z, 0.6_z, 1.0_s))
                              .SetMicLed(MicLed::Pulsating)
                              .Build();
        DaisyManager::Get()->SetControllerData(controller, outputData);
    }
}
```

## Installation

To use this library in a CMake project, there are several ways:

### Fetch content

```cmake
FetchContent_Declare(
        Daisy
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/localcc/Daisy.git
        GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(Daisy)

target_link_libraries(YOUR_TARGET PUBLIC Daisy)
```

### Submoduling

Add the library as a submodule to your repo, then add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory("Daisy")
target_link_libraries(YOUR_TARGET PUBLIC Daisy)
```

There are also other ways such as building a static library and linking to that, but that is left up to you to decide
on how you wanna use the library.

## Platform support

| Platform | status |
|----------|--------|
| Windows  | ‚úÖ      |
| macOS    | üõ†Ô∏è    |
| Linux    | üõ†Ô∏è    |

‚úÖ - Supported, üõ†Ô∏è - Work in progress, ‚ö†Ô∏è - Currently not planned.

## Notes

The library tries to keep allocations to a minimum, and as such, the only time memory is allocated is when a controller
is connected/disconnected. It also makes no multithreaded guarantees, and it is only safe to use from a single-thread
if not guarded with a mutex.

Controller connection/disconnection will not get detected until the `Tick` method is called.
